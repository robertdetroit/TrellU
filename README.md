## list of the students with whom you discussed the assignment:  
none

## any books, papers, or online resources that you consulted in developing your web site:  
the resource that I relied on the most was the example_firebase repo posted by Professor Duvall. Aside from  
that, I used the following resources:  
    * to learn how to make drop-down menu --> http://www.echoecho.com/htmlforms11.html  
    * to learn how to make css object overflow, for activitylog --> https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_overflow.asp
    * to learn how to change css attributes using jquery --> https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/css_css.asp
    * to learn how to make input color picker --> https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_input_color
    * to learn UTF arrow lingo -->  https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_arrows.asp

## any assets (code, images, or sounds) used within your web site:  
there are no assets aside from what someone will upload

## any bugs or concerns still remaining within your web site:  
for some reason, doing anything to the lists and cards will reset the page to the top, so  
that you always have to scroll down to see what you did.

Also, pressing Apply Changes button if you only upload an image  
will not let you go back to the minimized version of the card.

## challenging features implemented: 
    1. "View project "activities" that shows changes made to any card and when the change was made"
    2. "Make any number comments on a card"
    3. "Assign any number of users to a card"

## any extra credit features included in your web site:  
I've added a colorizer button for cards, that once pressed, makes a band in the card be colored to the category's set color
